## Writing Simplified

Journal is a tool used to streamline the writing process as well as organizing all my writing in an easy to access way. 

The application is entirely terminal based and uses the Vim text editor. 

To use please change the filepath of the ENTRY_DIR variable in the main.rs file, to the path you'd like to use to store your writing. The project is currently made solely for my own use but this could change in the future.

### Requirements

Rust + Cargo, sqlite and vim.

Build the project using 

`cargo build --release`

and move the compiled binary to your computers path.

This project is designed with Linux in mind.
